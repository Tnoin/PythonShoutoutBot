# PythonShoutoutBot
Its a python bot that gives a nice little shoutout message to pre-determined people when they talk in chat for the first time (since the bot has launched)


step 1: install python 3
step 2: go into settings and adjust the things (and maybe the shoutout message to if you have something like !shoutout, to trigger that)
step 3: go into oauth and put your key in
step 4: run it from the command line (or python tool of your choice)
step 5: it just works (unless it doesn't, in which case just ask me on discord)
